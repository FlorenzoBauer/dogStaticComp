## Static Comp Challenge 1 - Frontend Module 2

## Abstract
This is a project that require us to copy a static comp.

## Specification
No creative flexibility, we are to copy it in its entirety. 

## The Challenge
The hardest part was fonts. It was extremely hard finding the font and matching! I used a color picker extension for the first time and it made matching colors much easier! But fonts are still incredibly hard to find.
